Development
-----------

There is a makefile in the project root with targets for the most common
development operations such as lint checks, running unit tests, building
the documentation, and building installing packages. See makefile.

[Bumpversion](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bumpversion) is used to
manage the package version numbers. This ensures that the version number
is correctly incremented in all required files. Please see the
bumpversion documentation for usage instructions, and do not edit the
version strings directly.
